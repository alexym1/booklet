> Multivariate exploratory data analysis in R


## Overview
`booklet` is a ground-up rewrite of [FactoMineR](https://github.com/husson/FactoMineR/tree/master) that provides a set of functions for multivariate exploratory data analysis. It is designed to be a more user-friendly version of `FactoMineR`. The main goal was to make the package more intuitive and easier to use. The package is still under development, and some functions are not yet implemented. However, the main functions are already available.


## Installation

The latest version can be installed from GitHub as follows: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alexym1/booklet")
```

## Example

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(booklet)

# Get active individuals
X_active <- pca_standardize_norm(iris[, -5])
head(X_active)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Get eigs
eigs <- pca_eigen(X_active)
eigs$values
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Get principal components
ind_coords <- pca_ind_coords(eigs)
head(ind_coords)
```
